## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Vanilla Java Script

### What I learned

That was an interesting exercise to handle the business logic (tip calculation) while users are adding the inputs, so the result can be displayed instantaneously. To achieve that I had to be aware of dealing with default values for all inputs.

Also, an interesting part was styling and creating the functionality of the custom value, while having to handle a radio button dynamic for the other fixed tip percentage options.
